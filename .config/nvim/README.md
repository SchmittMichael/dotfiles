# Custom Neovim Config

## Prerequisites

- python
- node
- ripgrep
- zip
- make

## About
Throught the automatic installation of plugins using `lazy.nvim` and language-servers using `mason.nvim` the config should fully initialize it self given that all necessary tools are installed.  

Further language-servers can be installed as well but possible require further external package to fully work.
